## The Core Concept

Project Aegis is a modular, open-source framework that enables developers to build and deploy **proactive, deterministic AI agents** on Solana.

Current on-chain automation is **reactive**, forcing bots to compete in a chaotic, probabilistic auction for blockspace. This leads to execution failures, uncertain timing, and high costs.

Aegis uses Raiku's execution guaranteesâ€”**Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) slot reservations** and **Just-In-Time (JIT) slot auctions**â€”to transform blockspace into a predictable, plannable resource. This allows an AI agent to move beyond simple, reactive arbitrage and execute complex, time-based strategies with 100% certainty.

## Submission Deliverables

This repository contains all the required deliverables for the submission.

* ðŸ“„ **[Concept Document](./aegis.pdf):** A 2-page document detailing the problem, solution, framework architecture, and use cases.
* ðŸŽ¨ **[Visual Blueprint](./aegis_arch.png):** The architecture and sequence diagrams created in Excalidraw.

## Visual Blueprint

The following diagrams are included in the concept document and are presented here for clarity.

### Technical Architecture

This diagram shows the modular components of the Aegis Framework and how it connects developer logic to Raiku's primitives.

## Challenge Tracks

This project directly addresses the following challenge tracks:

* **Track 1: Finance Applications:** By proposing a framework for institutional-grade automation, enabling risk-free liquidations, deterministic arbitrage, and perfectly scheduled token launches.
* **Track 2: Open-Source Tooling:** The Aegis framework itself is a composable, open-source tool that makes Raiku's powerful primitives simple and accessible for all developers.
